# vellaChat

What is this?

This is a demo chat application created using node.js(Express),socket.io,Angular Js,MongoDb,Redis. It was created out of a desire to learn how these technologies worked. It is not yet suitable for use in a production environment - but it provides a decent overview of how to set up and create a chat application that uses socket.io for "comet" style data pushing.

In its current form the application allows for clients to POST messages to the server using an application specific key and those messages will in turn be pushed out to all clients viewing all the online users and notification according to the application that sent them.
